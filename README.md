# Ten years in Web technologies: 2004-2014

## 2004-01

- [Void filling: Web Applications
  Language](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1074466808&count=1) blog posting
  from [Ian Hickson](http://ln.hixie.ch/): <i>The W3C had so far
  failed to address a need in the Web community: There is no language
  for Web applications... I intend to do something about this
  (hopefully within a W3C context, although that will depend on the
  politics of the situation).</i>

## 2004-02

-   [Safari
    1.2](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_02.html#004874)
    released; first version of Safari with XMLHttpRequest support
-   [Flickr launched](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr); making
    innovative use of asynchronous scripting/Ajax mechanisms in its user
    interface, it will go on to become the [Web
    application](WebApplication "wikilink") most often cited in "Web
    2.0" discussions.
-   [CSS 2.1 Candidate
    Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-CSS21-20040225/)
    published; however, after this initial CR publication, the CSS 2.1
    spec will then go back to Working Draft status before returning
    again to CR status in July 2007.

## 2004-03

-   [Ramblings from the
    North](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1080506019&count=1) blog posting
    from [Ian Hickson](http://ln.hixie.ch/): <i>I've been taking the
    opportunity to work on a proposal for a Web Applications
    specification... something along the same lines as Web Forms 2, but
    specifically for client-side application development.</i>

## 2004-04

-   [Gmail launched](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail) in
    invitation-only beta.
-   [Web Applications
    1.0](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/html/apps/web-apps-1); first public
    draft of what will eventually become HTML5

## 2004-05

-   [Backwards
    Compatibility](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1085764602&count=1) blog
    posting from [Ian Hickson](http://ln.hixie.ch/): <i>Authors still
    want to write Web applications, and the currently deployed standards
    are inadequate. Since completely new standards won't cut it [...]
    this leaves us with the solution we (Opera and Mozilla) have been
    advocating: updating HTML and the DOM.</i>

## 2004-06

-   [W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound
    Documents](http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/) held at Adobe
    offices in San Jose; Opera and Mozilla jointly submit and present a
    position paper with a set of proposed [Design Principles for Web
    Application
    Technologies](http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/papers/opera.html);
    but some [subsequent blog
    postings](2004WebAppsWorkshop/reactions "wikilink") from [Brendan
    Eich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich), [David
    Baron](http://dbaron.org/), and [Ian Hickson](http://ln.hixie.ch/)
    make it clear that they have come away from the workshop with a
    realization that their goals with respect to [Web
    applications](WebApplication "wikilink") are not in sync with others
    in attendance. Brendan Eich:

> The dream of a new web, based on XHTML+SVG+SMIL+XForms, is just that
> -- a dream. It won't come true no matter how many toy implementations
> there are... The best way to help the Web is to incrementally improve
> the existing web standards, with compatibility shims provided for IE,
> so that web content authors can actually deploy new formats
> interoperably... Mozilla is joining with Opera and others to explore
> the sort of incremental improvements to HTML proposed by us at the
> workshop.

-   [WHATWG launched](http://www.whatwg.org/news/start): <i>The group
    aims to develop specifications based on HTML and related
    technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web
    Applications [...] for implementation in mass-market Web browsers,
    in particular Safari, Mozilla, and Opera; [the group] intends to
    ensure that all its specifications address backwards compatibility
    concerns [...] and specify error handling behavior to ensure
    interoperability even in the face of documents that do not comply to
    the letter of the specifications.</i>
-   [Atom Publishing Format and Protocol Working
    Group](http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2004-06-16-a.html) (atompub)
    chartered within the IETF Applications Area to 'use experience
    gained with RSS [...] as the basis for a standards-track document
    specifying the [Atom] model, syntax, and feed format. The feed
    format and HTTP will be used as the basis of work on a
    standards-track document specifying the editing protocol' and noting
    that the group will <i>take steps to ensure interoperability, by
    unambiguously identifying required elements in formats, clearly
    nominating conformance levels for different types of software, and
    providing clear extensibility mechanisms and constraints upon
    them.</i>

## 2004-07

-   [XML on the Web Has
    Failed](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html) article by
    [Mark Pilgrim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pilgrim), with this
    comment on [draconian error
    handling](DraconianErrorHandling "wikilink"): <i>The promise of
    "draconian error handling will save us" was an empty promise.
    Whatever interoperability we now enjoy has not been rooted in
    draconian error handling. Draconianism was a grand experiment, and
    maybe it could have ensured interoperability if clients hadn't been
    so buggy and the creators of XML had understood how it interacted
    with other specifications (like MIME) from the beginning, instead of
    being blindsided by it years later.</i>

## 2004-08

-   [First public
    release](http://snapshot.opera.com/windows/w760p1.html) of an Opera
    build with with some degree of XMLHttpRequest support (v7.60

    <i>Web 2.0</i> to be brought into general use.
-   [Compound Document Formats Activity and Working
    Group](http://www.w3.org/News/2004#x20041007b) launched, with
    deliverables [described
    as](http://www.w3.org/2004/CDF/admin/charter): <i>Specifications for
    combining W3C technologies, such as SMIL, SVG and XML Events, with
    XHTML by reference</i> and <i>Specifications for combining W3C
    technologies, such as XHTML, XML Events, CSS, SVG, SMIL and XForms,
    into a single document by inclusion</i>.

## 2005-02

## 2005-09

-   [What Is Web
    2.0](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html)
    article by Tim O'Reilly. Subsequent discussions of the term <i>Web
    2.0</i> often cite this article; excerpt: <i>It's clear that
    standards and solutions [...] will enable the next generation of
    applications. [...] AJAX is also a key component of Web 2.0
    applications such as Flickr [...] We're entering an unprecedented
    period of user interface innovation, as web developers are finally
    able to build web applications as rich as local PC-based
    applications.</i>

## 2005-11

-   [Web API](http://www.w3.org/2006/webapi/) and [Web Application
    Formats](http://www.w3.org/2006/appformats/) Working Groups

    Activity](http://www.w3.org/News/2005#x200501115c)

## 2005-12 and 2006-01

-   [RFC 4287](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287) (The Atom Syndication
    Format) published by the IETF.
-   [The future of HTML, Part 1:
    WHATWG](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-futhtml1/)
    and [The future of HTML, Part 2: XHTML
    2.0](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-futhtml2.html)
    articles by Edd Dumbill as that IBM developerWorks site:
    > The W3C promotes XHTML 2.0, based on the requirements of a broad
    > vendor base -- not just desktop browser makers. XHTML 2.0 is seen
    > as a radical step. In contrast, the Web Hypertext Application
    > Technology Working Group (WHATWG) promotes a set of incremental
    > specifications, which evolve HTML to add the most immediately
    > required functionality into the browser... The
    > grassroots-organised WHATWG aims for a gently incremental
    > enhancement of HTML 4 and XHTML 1.0, whereas the
    > consortium-sponsored XHTML 2.0 is a comprehensive refactoring of
    > the HTML language.

-   [Web Authoring Statistics](http://code.google.com/webstats/) report
    published at Google Code site: <i>...we did an analysis of a sample
    of slightly over a billion documents, extracting information about

    Draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-web-forms-2-20060821/) published
    by W3C Web Application Formats Working Group; see also the
    subsequent [public
    discussion](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-appformats/2006Aug/thread.html#msg156)
    initiated by John Boyer and cross-posted to several mailing lists
    (following an earlier discussion thread on the member-only list for
    W3C chairs): <i>IBM strongly advocates for the renewed charter of
    the XForms and HTML working groups to include unification of the Web
    Forms 2.0 work with emphases on the ease-of-use benefits from WF2
    and the XML basis from XForms.</i>

-   [Reinventing HTML](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/166)
    posting by Tim Berners-Lee: <i>Some things are clearer with
    hindsight of several years. It is necessary to evolve HTML
    incrementally. The attempt to get the world to switch to XML,
    including quotes around attribute values and slashes in empty tags
    and namespaces all at once didn't work... The plan is to charter a
    completely new HTML group. Unlike the previous one, this one will be
    chartered to do incremental improvements to HTML, as also in
    parallel xHTML.</i>

## 2006-11

-   [Proposed
    charter](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2006Nov/0045.html)
    for HTML Working group posted by [Ian Hickson](http://ln.hixie.ch/)
    (following [the earlier posting of shorter proposed
    charter](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2006Nov/0000.html),
    [specific
    feedback](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2006Nov/0000.html)
    and some [public discussion about charter
    review](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2006Nov/thread.html#msg53));
    among some language of the proposed charter that don't make it into
    the final charter is the phrase <i>APIs for the manipulation of
    sound, 2D bitmap and vector graphics, 3D graphics, video</i>, which
    gets reduced instead to the phrase <i> APIs for the manipulation of
    linked media</i>.

## 2007-03

    with a mission <i>to continue the evolution of HTML (including
    classic HTML and XML syntaxes)</i> and with a statement that <i>this

    specification [to produce] a language evolved from HTML4 for
    describing the semantics of documents and applications on the World
    Wide Web.</i>
