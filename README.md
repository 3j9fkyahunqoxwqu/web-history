# Ten years in Web technologies: 2004-2014

## 2004-01

- [Void filling: Web Applications Language](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1074466808&count=1)
  blog posting from Ian Hickson:
  <i>The W3C had so far failed to address a need in the Web community: There is
  no language for Web applications... I intend to do something about this
  (hopefully within a W3C context, although that will depend on the politics of
  the situation).</i>

## 2004-02

- [Safari 1.2](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_02.html#004874)
  released; first version of Safari with XMLHttpRequest support

- [Flickr launched](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr); making
  innovative use of asynchronous scripting/Ajax mechanisms in its user
  interface, it will go on to become the Web application]most often cited in
  "Web 2.0" discussions.

- [CSS 2.1 Candidate Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-CSS21-20040225/)
  published; however, after this initial CR publication, the CSS 2.1 spec will
  then go back to Working Draft status before returning again to CR status in
  July 2007.

## 2004-03

- [Ramblings from the North](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1080506019&count=1)
  blog posting from Ian Hickson:
  <i>I've been taking the opportunity to work on a proposal for a Web
  Applications specification... something along the same lines as Web Forms 2,
  but specifically for client-side application development.</i>

## 2004-04

- [Gmail launched](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail)
  in invitation-only beta.

- [Web Applications 1.0](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/html/apps/web-apps-1);
  first public draft of what will eventually become HTML5

## 2004-05

- [Backwards Compatibility](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1085764602&count=1)
  blog posting from Ian Hickson:
  <i>Authors still want to write Web applications, and the currently deployed
  standards are inadequate. Since completely new standards won't cut it [...]
  this leaves us with the solution we (Opera and Mozilla) have been advocating:
  updating HTML and the DOM.</i>

## 2004-06

- [W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents](http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/)
  held at Adobe offices in San Jose; Opera and Mozilla jointly submit and
  present a position paper with a set of proposed
  [Design Principles for Web Application Technologies](http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/papers/opera.html);
  but some
  [subsequent blog postings](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/2004WebAppsWorkshop/reactions)
  from Brendan Eich, David Baron, and Ian Hickson make it clear that they have
  come away from the workshop with a realization that their goals with respect
  to Web applications are not in sync with others in attendance. Brendan Eich:

> The dream of a new web, based on XHTML+SVG+SMIL+XForms, is just that -- a
> dream. It won't come true no matter how many toy implementations there are...
> The best way to help the Web is to incrementally improve the existing web
> standards, with compatibility shims provided for IE, so that web content
> authors can actually deploy new formats interoperably... Mozilla is joining
> with Opera and others to explore the sort of incremental improvements to HTML
> proposed by us at the workshop.

- [WHATWG launched](http://www.whatwg.org/news/start):
  <i>The group aims to develop specifications based on HTML and related
  technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web Applications [...]
  for implementation in mass-market Web browsers, in particular Safari, Mozilla,
  and Opera; [the group] intends to ensure that all its specifications address
  backwards compatibility concerns [...] and specify error handling behavior to
  ensure interoperability even in the face of documents that do not comply to
  the letter of the specifications.</i>

## 2004-08

  article by Tim O'Reilly. Subsequent discussions of the term
  <i>Web 2.0</i> often cite this article; excerpt:
  <i>It's clear that standards and solutions [...] will enable the next
  generation of applications. [...] AJAX is also a key component of Web 2.0
  applications such as Flickr [...] We're entering an unprecedented period of
  user interface innovation, as web developers are finally able to build web
  applications as rich as local PC-based applications.</i>

- [Reinventing HTML](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/166)
  posting by Tim Berners-Lee:
  <i>Some things are clearer with hindsight of several years. It is necessary to
  evolve HTML incrementally. The attempt to get the world to switch to XML,
  including quotes around attribute values and slashes in empty tags and
  namespaces all at once didn't work... The plan is to charter a completely new
  HTML group. Unlike the previous one, this one will be chartered to do
  incremental improvements to HTML, as also in parallel xHTML.</i>
